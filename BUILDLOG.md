Initialised repo! ðŸŽ‰

Some issues with dev containers, wanted to treat this as a monorepo with a dev container for
each package but VSCode doesn't support being able to do that while also having access to git
so I've gone with a single dev container.

Starting on the backend, used Poetry (because it's the best) to get started, installed FastAPI
but haven't started APIs yet. Trying out Behave instead of pytest-bdd which is my go-to. It's
interesting, the context is similar to what I've done in the past but fixtures are quite different.

Haven't decided on a database yet so using an in-memory repository for now.

Mostly following my usual pattern of splitting domain and service with an API layer to come later.
